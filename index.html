        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item">
            <p>As a freshman in college, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career and even less of an idea on how to figure that out.
            I ended up pursuing degrees in History and Museum Studies and then working at Starbucks after graduation, still not knowing what I might like to do for a job. 
            While the Covid-19 pandemic has been difficult and tragic in many ways, I took it as an opportunity to pause my current work life and really explore 
            what I want to do and what might make me happy.</p> 
        
            <p>Since taking an HTML-focused computer class in highschool, I have always had an interest in coding and technology but never felt 
            like it was a career option. At the beginning of the pandemic, while Starbucks' across the country were shutdown, I did some reasearch 
            and took some free online courses that reinforced my interest in these areas and pushed me in the 
            direction of a career move into a technology based field. In my research I found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>. This program is allowing
            me to do something I never thought I would be able to do again. I am loving this opportunity to learn a new and challenging skillset in a field that I enjoy 
            and aspire to use in the future to work with like-minded people and hopefully make some positive contributions to society.</p>
